I made a bot that tracks the prices of any product on websites and sends you an email when it drops below a threshold
dict_file contains the websites and the desired xpath
text.txt contains a message that will be put in the email
You still need to configure your email and password for
I'm also pretty sure that the sending only works for gmail email
